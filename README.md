# AI-plays-Baagchal  
In this repository, I'll be writing an AI to play Baagchal using minimax algorithm.  
  

## Usage
If you directly want to run the executable file without worrying about installing python and installing configparser, the windows version is available in [release](https://github.com/Bishalsarang/AI-plays-Baagchal/releases) for downloads.
 
 Alternatively,
